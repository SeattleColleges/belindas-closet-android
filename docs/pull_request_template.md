### **Pull requests should follow a common structure for organizational purposes and quick readability.** 

# **Naming convention for PR titles**
< repo > _ < sprint > _ < issue > _ < pr or issue name >\
\
Example:\
belindas-closet-android_2_5_landing-page\
This would be for the belindas-closet-android repo, sprint 2, issue 5, with the name "landing page."\

# **When first submitting your pull request, make sure to assign it on github to your team members who will be responsible for validating your pull request and make sure there are no merge conflicts.**

# **After assigning to a particular member set, we can then assign it to a proper project if you are working across multiple repos. This is especially important for the above reason, and is a fantastic way to organize your pull requests without mixing up where they are intended to go.**

# **We can also assign a label to the pull request. This lets your PM/PO/ etc know what this pull request applies to. This makes assessing what we're looking for very quick and easy as a Project Manager, or other leader within the team.**
